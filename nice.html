		<tr>
			<td class="center">A</td>
			<td>I liked using google drive. I had a chance to use
      Github Classroom and like that better. The only disadvantage was collaberation
    other than that it worked well to get up to date information and host our information.</td>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="center">B</td>
			<td>I would definetly prefer all course materials to be on google
      drive in comparison to Canvas or Blackboard</td>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="center">C</td>
			<td>Working in groups was nice when I was sick and needed to rely on someone
      to get some work done. I did not really learn anything from my group and towards the end of the semester there were a
    couple of disappointing circumstances. I feel overall everyone pulled their weight.</td>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="center">D</td>
			<td>The tests were perfect and played on the group work well. I feel they all
      had one or two things that were a little fun to figure out. I would classify them as just right. The work load was just right as well.</td>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="center">E</td>
			<td>I had no trouble installing XAMPP on my personal computer. On my work computer I had to troubleshoot and give a a different Port.</td>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="center">F</td>
			<td>I gave up on the virtual machine. It was terrible and would freeze or tell me applications were crashing.</td>

		</tr>
		<tr>

			<td class ="center">G</td>
			<td>I liked this course much better than an online course. Having a lecture session and time to work and ask questions made
      it easier to troubleshoot and work through issues.</td>
		</tr>

    <tr>

      <td class ="center">H</td>
      <td>I am happy with the coverage of the course. However, I would have like to breifly touch on other Databases other than MariaDB</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td class ="center">I</td>
      <td>I think it would be cool to use the sakilla DB to analyze data or trends and get a small glimpse into some analysis or trends</td>
